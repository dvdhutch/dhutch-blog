Here’s a scoping account of the university, including its contribution to Western values such as liberalism and democracy, and the changing nature of the university in response to demographic and economic trends.

**The Big Picture**

The tradition of the university — perhaps best though of as an idea rather than a place — is part and parcel with the development of ‘The West’ as both a physical history and a set of ideas that govern society. There were certainly institutions devoted to learning that came about before the university, such as [Harran University](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/harran) (or more likely, the Madrasa of Harran), in modern-day southeastern Turkey. In fact, the idea of an institute dedicated to the pursuit of teaching and learning in the arts and sciences is largely a byproduct of the Islamic Golden Age, a period of literary, scientific, and cultural expansion across the Middle East and North Africa. Here is a simple breakdown of the history of the Islamic Golden Age, which influenced the later European Renaissance and Enlightenment periods.  [1]

It is important to understand the impact of the university as a force for good across the globe through its longstanding relationship to broad ideas like individualism, liberalism, tolerance, and academic freedom. Importantly, the university divorced itself from religion, forming the bedrock of secular education as we know it today; this has resulted in positive learning outcomes being concentrated in the Western World (which have since proliferated across the rest of the world).

One example of this is the Harvard Charter of 1650, which chose to endorse the liberal arts over a religious curriculum:

> *And that all the aforesaid transactions shall tend to and for the use and behoof of the President Fellows scholars and officers of the said College and for all accommodations of buildings books and all other necessary provisions and furnitures as may be for the advancement and education of youth in all manner of good literature arts and sciences.* (Harvard University Archives)

Further, the presence of universities in cities, nation-states, and eventual multi-ethnic empires has accompanied greater swaths of the population gaining access to tertiary education opportunities, which correlate to higher life expectancies and a whole host of other positive health and wellness outcomes. For instance, these data are illustrative of the change over time in access to higher education: [2]
