In this week’s blog, I’m going to be sharing some lessons that I wish I’d heard when I was younger; both in high school, and as an underclassmen at Penn State. More generally, though, I think these ideas can apply to anyone looking for advice about finding their lane at any point of their academic career.

It’s important to note that there’s no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to giving (or receiving) advice. Everyone comes with different perspectives on life, and that is okay. In sharing these pieces of advice I hope to provide a loose framework for thinking about the world and the ways you can focus your impact on what is most important to you.

**It’s better to have a large impact on a few things than a small impact on many things**

One of the temptations of the undergraduate is to become involved in as many things as possible. Perhaps this is carry-over from high school, where the common refrain says something like “be in as many clubs as possible so that you will be well-rounded and have the best odds of getting into a T-20 school.” This is a false presumption.

One of the joys of the undergraduate experience is having a real world impact on the campus you inhabit. For me, that work has centered on connecting student performing arts organizations with university resources writ large. It’s been leading the largest section (I see you trumpets) in the best marching band in the B1G 10 (yuh). And it’s been bootstrapping a startup from an idea in my head into a class project into a real team that’s moving forward and making tools for teachers. Admittedly, this is probably the hardest of the entire list for me. I like doing a lot of things. But it’s better to do a few things well than milquetoast at very many.

**Find a schedule that works for you**

Identify when you are most productive and least productive. For me, that’s early mornings. I thrive in them. I can’t do work at night — I can’t focus as well when I’m tired. Listen to what your body needs: is it a better exercise routine? More consistent eating habits? Make a plan and stick to it, but understand that there is no such thing as a ‘perfect’ schedule. Adapt as needed.

**Identify your values**

Critical for me. PLA has helped me immensely here! I think of values in the same vein as habits. People with successful habits build them on strong values — which compounds their success in the long run. Don’t discount the important of religion, either. Understand that humans are naturally spiritual, and consider how your values impact your physical health, mental health, and spiritual health.

> Mike Tyson

Your values are what you fall back on when you get punched in the mouth. How will you choose to react?

**Leverage your network (but don’t schmooze)**

Penn State rules when it comes to building networks — we’re great at it. I think about my network as the group of people that I could call on if I needed help with a domain specific problem (e.g., Yo Ben, what’s up with Silicon Valley Bank. Is it safe to keep my assets in there?), advice with a major life decision, or just someone to break bread with. The key here is to make sure that you don’t schmooze. Nobody likes people who schmooze. Make sure you talk to people naturally — and don’t tell them what they want to hear — tell them what is right!

If the conversation doesn’t end with you feeling some sort of positive emotion, it probably wasn’t meant to be. And that’s okay too!

**Consistency beats hard work**

I could give you some examples for this, but I think we all know that it’s true. Especially true in the pursuit of long-term goals.

**It’s okay to ask for help**

Major key alert! One of the best things I’ve come to learn in my time as a student at Penn State. Often, as PLAers, we’re great at giving advice that we come up short on ourselves. I’ve been wrong so many times. People want to help you, even if you don’t think that you want help. Something I’m still working on every day. What we do is hard — and it’s important to get help when you need it. Leverage your network in times of need, and give yourself the time and space to fully appreciate what has been done and what is yet to be.

**Intentionality —> Prosperity**

Boom.

**Humility is important the further along you get**

It’s easy to be the kid in the basement with a dream. At least, it’s easier to be humble when you have nothing to show. Keep that attitude with you, no matter what the external world throws at you. You are still the kid with the dream, who knows, deep down, that you will do great things. I believe in you!

**Dream big! It might just happen**

Make big bets, power law, asymmetric outcomes, yaddah yaddah…just read this. And then maybe watch this.

**Don’t take yourself too seriously**

This goes without saying — but we’re all guilty of it. Something I am still working on every day!

**Be ferociously curious about the world**

Probably the most important thing for me on this list. Unfortunately, this is also the one thing that, in my opinion, is the hardest to learn. If you can even learn it.

Never stop asking questions. Ever. Sure, people that are ferociously curious are also naturally discontent people. I’ll admit to being naturally discontent. But availing yourself to all that exists in the world is enthralling — and the single-largest determinant of success or failure in my book.

The world can take everything from me, but as long as there is an earth to explore, I’ll be okay. In place of further prose, enjoy some Anthony Bourdain quotes, who is the human epitome of this spirit.

> *If you’re twenty-two, physically fit, hungry to learn and be better, I urge you to travel – as far and as widely as possible. Sleep on floors if you have to. Find out how other people live and eat*
> *and cook. Learn from them – wherever you go.*
>
> *Travel changes you. As you move through this life and this world you change things slightly, you*
> *leave marks behind, however small. And in return, life – and travel – leaves marks on you. Most of the time, those marks – on your body or on your heart – are beautiful. Often, though, they hurt.*
>
> *I’ve long believed that good food, good eating, is all about risk. Whether we’re talking about*
> *unpasteurized Stilton, raw oysters or working for organized crime ‘associates,’ food, for me, has* 
> *always been an adventure.*
>
> *The way you make an omelet reveals your character.*

**Live your life excellently**

No one is better than you, but you are better than no one.
