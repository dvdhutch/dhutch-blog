Providing clear narratives is an important skill to effectively convey future intent, especially when thinking about shaping the way future students will interact with technology in school and home settings. For instance, itâ€™s probably more useful to begin using AGI tools like ChatGPT, Bard, etc. in computer science courses rather than English in public schools, at least for the time being. Similarly, these tools can be positive forces for scaffolding student thinking and brainstorming, but may not be suited for grading student assignments, rewriting papers, and providing reliable citations, for now. All this is to say that it is most helpful to provide a clear picture of what specific technology could be implemented in schools and decide on what data points are meaningful to support this.

There are many angles to consider and points of view that have importance to the discussion in the community, but above all the career I wish to pursue is one that is in service to students and teachers.

These are the thought processes I have been going through as I prepare applications to continue to study and research learning science at the graduate level. **Equipping students with the tools they need to flourish in an age of AI gives them an incomparable advantage.** Therefore, technologists and capital allocators must do what they can to provide access to tools for as wide a net of students as possible. It is my intention to bridge the gap between builders and educators as I continue to pursue my education.
