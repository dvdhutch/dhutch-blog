In all, making this website took about five hours. If you follow these steps you'll be able to create your own website in this time (or less)!

The most important step is the one you take before you begin. Do you have an idea of what kind of website you'd like to create? For my purposes, I sought websites that incorporated clean and minimalistic web design with and easy-to-use functionality. I needed the flexibility to customize the design while coding in a framework that lends itself to easy content creation. Here are some of my favorite portfolio websites:
